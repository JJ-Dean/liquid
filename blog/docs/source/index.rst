HonestLLM is a tool that allows users to verify the accuracy of the output of AI models and provides information about the reason behind them.

The goal of the project is to develop technologies to determine the authenticity of the output of AI models and to prevent hallucinations. Users will be able to visually check the reliability of their answers using a fact-based database.

Through this, we will create a safe and reliable artificial intelligence environment and a more certain and advanced future.
